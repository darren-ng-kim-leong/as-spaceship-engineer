My passion is to explore new places, the stranger the better.<br /><br />I have a fascination (obsession?) with Iceland. The people is super-friendly and the geography there is super-dramatic. I am in love with the land there where it is flat for as far as eye can see, and then suddenly, there is a 90-degree cliff out in the middle. The place is simply majestic, magical."
